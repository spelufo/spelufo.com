      <description>I decided to program the game Tablero di Berona, by James Ernest, as an exercise. He explains how to play in this video. There&amp;rsquo;s also a pdf with the rules on his site.
Object orientation is a natural fit, since we are simulating real objects. So a way to approach this is to define classes for Board and Piece and go from there. Maybe start bottom-up by implementing drawing and movement of pieces, to see results on the screen quickly.</description>

      <description>When making things for the web we first run them on our machines at a local port. We start a server from the command line and browse to localhost:8080 or similar. The port number is not important, any high port that is not in use will do. But it is one more thing to keep in mind, one more subtle difference between development and production. The browser&amp;rsquo;s address suggestion doesn&amp;rsquo;t work the same.</description>
